            <h3>I'm a <span> Student in in University of Bengkulu</span></h3>
            <p>
                I am a student in the English Education program. I chose this major because I have a great interest in foreign languages such as English and German. While studying English, I feel happy and always determined that I must be fluent in English because it is my first choice I believe that mastering English will open many opportunities for me in the future, both in my career and in personal growth. I am committed to continuously improving my skills through practice, learning from different resources, and engaging in conversations. My goal is to become not only fluent but also confident when communicating in English, as it is an essential part of my dreams and aspirations.
                <br>
                I also realize that the journey to becoming fluent in English requires time, patience, and dedication. Therefore, I strive to keep my motivation high by setting realistic learning goals and enjoying the process. With a positive attitude and consistent effort, I am confident that my English skills will continue to improve over time I am inspired by the idea that learning a language is not just about grammar and vocabulary but also about understanding different cultures and perspectives. This motivates me to immerse myself in English through reading, watching, and listening to various media. By doing so, I can develop a deeper connection with the language and enhance my ability to use it naturally in different contexts.
                <br>
               I am determined to seek opportunities to practice my English with native speakers and fellow learners. Joining language clubs, participating in discussions, and attending workshops are some of the activities that I plan to engage in. I believe that real-life practice is essential for developing fluency and confidence. Each experience will bring me one step closer to my goal of mastering English and using it effectively in any situation.
